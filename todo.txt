*add max wave like 	wave 1/15
main menu does not work
add missile
add selectiing gun when clicking on it on the field
add target priorities
*dragging turret from build bar without releasing click
destroy turrets 
particles should be above other tanks always
sometimes if I press buy button before i get enough money
  and continue clicking after I get it it prints that I cant affort turret 
sometimes it freezes on the second wave with no reason
 may be it cuz of speeding up

tank does not receive damage cuz there are several tanks in one place
 so actualy they are receiving damage

turrets:
 flamethrower
 railgun
 grom tanki online
 freeze (not like liquid but like a gun)
